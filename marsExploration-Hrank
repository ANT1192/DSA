int marsExploration(string s) {
    
    int altered_letters = 0;
    for (size_t i = 1; i < s.length(); i += 3) {
        altered_letters += (s[i - 1] != 'S');
        altered_letters += (s[i] != 'O');
        altered_letters += (s[i + 1] != 'S');
    }
    return altered_letters;

}
Code explanation:
1. The function `marsExploration` in C++ takes a `const std::string&` as input, which is passed by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.
2. A loop iterates over every set of three characters in the string, checking if they match the expected "SOS" pattern. If they don't, `altered_letters` is incremented.
