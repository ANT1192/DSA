Use BOOL function when need to eleminate data and to do that use condition to eleminate either false ones or true ones by stting default bool flag to True/False as per you've thought out the algorithm.

"12.09."+to_string(year) this "+to_string" is used to add (int year) to a string to return final result as "12.09.1999" if year was 1999.


Length of string:
Using strlen() Method
Using string::length() Method of String Class
Using string::size() Method of String Class
Using Iterative for Loop


Sr.No	Function & Purpose
1	
strcpy(s1, s2);

Copies string s2 into string s1.

2	
strcat(s1, s2);

Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.

3	
strlen(s1);

Returns the length of string s1.

4	
strcmp(s1, s2);

Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.

5	
strchr(s1, ch);

Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.

6	
strstr(s1, s2);

Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.



Function	Description

TO CONVERT UpperCase to Lower
string s = "GEEKSFORGEEKS"; 
    
    for (auto& x : s) { 
        x = tolower(x); 
    } 


Iteration in a set 
for(auto it=Set.begin();it!=Set.end();++it)
    {
        cout<<*it;
    }
