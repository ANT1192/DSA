Use BOOL function when need to eleminate data and to do that use condition to eleminate either false ones or true ones by stting default bool flag to True/False as per you've thought out the algorithm.
"12.09."+to_string(year) this "+to_string" is used to add (int year) to a string to return final result as "12.09.1999" if year was 1999.
