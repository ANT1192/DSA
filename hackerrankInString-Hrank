string hackerrankInString(string s) {
    string p= "hackerrank";
    int j=0;
    for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
    {
        if(s[i]==p[j])
        {
            j++;
        }
    }
    if(p.size()==j)
    return "YES";
    else
     return "NO";

}

The hackerrankInString function checks if the string "hackerrank" appears as a subsequence in the input string s. Here's how the function works:

The string p = "hackerrank" is defined as the target string to search for.
The variable j keeps track of the position in the string p that needs to be matched.
The loop goes through each character in the string s. For every character that matches the current character in p[j], it increments j.
If the entire string p is found as a subsequence (i.e., j equals the length of p), it returns "YES", otherwise, it returns "NO".
Example Explanation:
For s = "hereiamstackerrank", the function would return "YES" because the characters of "hackerrank" appear in order as a subsequence in s.
For s = "hackerworld", it would return "NO" because not all characters of "hackerrank" are present in sequence.
